# Momraj Chat App

Let’s have a chat with your friends!

## About this Fork
This repository, **Momraj Chat App**, is my personal adaptation of a full‑stack chat application. 
I’ve kept credit to the original team and simplified the setup so it’s easy to make this *your* project.

> Original concept/documentation credit: BNTA Cohort 6 (April, Hangqing, Joao, Migle, Yongran).

## Features (in the original project)
- Login and registration
- Add/remove friends
- One‑to‑one chats
- Switch between conversations

## What this repository currently includes
- Updated **README** (this file)
- A polished **.gitignore** for Node/React/Express projects
- An updated **package.json** with your own metadata placeholder

> To *run* the full app, you’ll eventually need both the frontend (React) and backend (Express + MongoDB) source folders. You can add those later.

## Quick Start (get this into your GitHub)
1. Create a new repository on GitHub named **momraj** (or any name you like).
2. Upload the three files from this folder: `.gitignore`, `README.md`, and `package.json`.
   - On GitHub, click **Add file → Upload files**, drag them in, then **Commit changes**.
3. (Optional) After you add the actual source code folders, you’ll be able to install and run it locally.

## Next Steps (when you add source code)
1. Backend (Express + MongoDB)
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
2. Frontend (React)
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.

## Notes
- This fork is intentionally minimal so you can start simple, then grow.
- Update the placeholders in `package.json` (name, author) whenever you’re ready.
